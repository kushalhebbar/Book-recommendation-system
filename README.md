# Book-recommendation-system
User rating based book recommendation system that considers network properties such as shortest path and similar neighbors to produce recommendations

Recommendation systems are a form of information filtering that is based on preferences of the user. The focus of a recommendation system is to improve user experience and interaction with the system to increase traffic and in turn increase company revenue. Recommendation systems are used in a range of areas such as music, movies, books, news, restaurants, search engines. User preferences are tracked through user inputs, previous interactions with the system or by accessing web cookies, based on these preferences recommendations are generated to keep the user engaged with the platform.

This repository contains a book recommendation system based on network analysis. It consists of 2 methods: common neighbors and shortest path. 

For a detail description of the methods and the EDA on the BookCrossing dataset please take a look at the report attached within the repo. 

The following are the instructions to successfully run the project:
- Download the dataset from the following link: http://www2.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/~cziegler/BX/
- Execute the Pre-processing python script 
- This will result in 2 new csv files (new_books.csv and final.csv)
- Execute the Recommender python script 
- Follow instructions on screen to see the recommendation system working (For example inputs refer to the report)
- To evaluate the performance of the algorithm execute the Evaluation python script

Hopefully, this acts as a base to creative and new research in the field of recommender systems.
